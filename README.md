# The Ritualists
There have been reports that in the village of Pennaultier, rituals have been taking place. Many have sought truth to the hearsay of gaining riches at these gatherings. But some whispers are, that some of the delegations have not made it back. Are you willing to find out if these rituals bring riches?

## Items needed
- Two different color dices, but one will suffice
- The Covenstead board

## The rules
You need five or six Meeples before the ritual can start. The fifth player who enters their Meeple in the Ritual, is asked to start the ceremony early, or wait for a sixth player. When decided to wait, the sixth player has to start the ritual at the time when the Meeple enters the Convenstead.

### Starting the ritual
To enter the dark ritual, simply place your Meeple on the next available spot at the Covenstead. Your Meeple will now take place in the Ritual and will not be available for other actions until the Ritual has ended.

### Participating
To enter the dark ritual, simply place your Meeple on the next available spot at the Covenstead. Your Meeple will now take place in the Ritual and will not be available for other actions until the Ritual has ended.


### The Ceremony
When the Ceremony starts, heartbeats will rise. The last participant must roll the dice twice. Once for the creeple to pick the Meeple. The second empowering the philosipher's stone. 
Who gets the riches and who will be left in the ditches?


### The conclusion
While the picked Meeple is getting sliced, others are being enticed. Spoils are given, for each Meeple's seat. You'll find the value at their feet. The player who's lost this unfortunate Meeple, awaits a reward to be awed by other people. It's value is multiplied by the philosipher's stone, bringing many riches back home.
When the empty spot is rolled and no unfortunate Meeple is picked, each Meeple goes back with their win and none of them loses their skin.

```
In other words: The eyes of first dice roll appoints the Meeple who will be sacrificed. This Meeple will no longer take place in the game.The assigned points at its seat will be muliplied with the eyes of the second roll and be gained by its player. 

All other Meeples in the convenstead will survive and will go back to their player's supply. Each plqyer will gain the assigned points of the seat their Meeple took in the Ritual.
If the sixth spot was chosen to be empty, and appointed by the first dice roll, no Meeples will be harmed. All can go home and bring their assigned points.
